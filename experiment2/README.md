Color: The sky, and bird colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the Photoshop eyedropper tool. Since it is “impressionistic”, I chose colors that make the stone more contrasting.
Primitives: Clouds are made from ellipse() overlays; waves are multiple line(); seabirds are drawn directly with point()/arc() to create little black dots and flight arcs.All done with just the basic p5 elements, no custom shapes.
Polygons: The dark green cliff in the distance and the two reefs in the foreground both use beginShape() + multiple vertex() to randomly generate a noisy silhouette, then fill in the shadows once, and the highlights once, to create a three-dimensional silhouette.
Composition: Different random seed values lead to he position and size of the clouds are rearranged, the landing points of the seabirds are all refreshed, and the cliff noise is resampled.
Life: The zoff accumulates with each frame, creating the effect of clouds drifting slowly from left to right.

This is a spaceship generator that randomly generates the wings, shape, fighter, transport, jump jet, and equipment of the spaceship, whether it be machine guns or missiles.

The inspiration I got was mainly because I have always been a science fiction fan, 
so I have always liked the universe, spaceships, and science fiction-related elements, which is why I chose this as a starting point.

And I also want to try to see how different the spaceships generated by the generator are from those in Star Citizen.
